# robot_arm_test
documenting the steps I took to install the robot_arm_pkg and simulate it.

This task was implemented on an ubuntu OS version 18.04 as a VM running under virtualbox.

In order to run and simulate this project I need to install ROS and many packages it uses for 2D/3D simulation among other packages. The documentation for installing ROS is http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu.

```
$ roscore
```

this command is used to start the master node which starts the node network.

A catkin workspace is needed, it comes with the full installation of ROS so all I need to do build the workspace. The documentation for doing that is http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials/create_a_workspace.
