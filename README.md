# robot_arm_test
documenting the steps I took to install the robot_arm_pkg and simulate it.

This task was implemented on an ubuntu OS version 18.04 as a VM running under virtualbox.

In order to run and simulate this project I need to install ROS and many packages it uses for 2D/3D simulation among other packages. The documentation for installing ROS are http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu .
